'min' is a function from the file /usr/lib/octave/3.6.4/oct/i686-redhat-linux-gnu/max.oct

 -- Loadable Function: min (X)
 -- Loadable Function: min (X, Y)
 -- Loadable Function: min (X, [], DIM)
 -- Loadable Function: min (X, Y, DIM)
 -- Loadable Function: [W, IW] = min (X)
     For a vector argument, return the minimum value.  For a matrix
     argument, return the minimum value from each column, as a row
     vector, or over the dimension DIM if defined, in which case Y
     should be set to the empty matrix (it's ignored otherwise).  For
     two matrices (or a matrix and scalar), return the pair-wise
     minimum.  Thus,

          min (min (X))

     returns the smallest element of X, and

          min (2:5, pi)
             =>  2.0000  3.0000  3.1416  3.1416

     compares each element of the range '2:5' with 'pi', and returns a
     row vector of the minimum values.

     For complex arguments, the magnitude of the elements are used for
     comparison.

     If called with one input and two output arguments, 'min' also
     returns the first index of the minimum value(s).  Thus,

          [x, ix] = min ([1, 3, 0, 2, 0])
             =>  x = 0
                 ix = 3
